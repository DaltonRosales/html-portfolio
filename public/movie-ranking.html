<h2>The top three</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>I love this movie so much, because it has so much detail in the animation the story is very creative and it touches on emotional topics.</p>
<h3>The Boy the Mole the Fox and the Horse</h3>
<p>So this movie was a short film, but it was amazing the animation was very different and simple but had a cozy feel to it and the film touched on some sad topics that turned them into an understanding. </p>
<h3>Spider-Man Across the Spider Verse</h3>
<p>This movie is way ahead of it's time since it has created an entirly new type of animation and inspired many other movies to make similair animation the voice acting was good and the story it had was the same as many other movies but it added a new twist to it, and the music made the movie feel so thrilling or very sad.</p>
